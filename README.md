The goal of our study is to compare the expression of genes related to metabolism of DFT1 cell lines to
DFT2 cell lines.
Our main goal is comparing genes expressed in the following pathways: Glycolysis, Pentose Phosphate
Pathway, Fatty Acid Metabolism, Glutaminolysis and Oxidative Phosphorylation.
A secondary goal would be to compare the expression of genes related to the production of Reactive
Oxygen Species (ROS) and protection against ROS (genes involved in DNA repair, production of
antioxydants etc).
Finally, we might also be interested in looking into genes linked to cholesterol metabolism as this has
been shown to be important for DFT1 but I need to do some additional reading to know what exactly we're
after.
See sample sheet below (edited from Yin Peng), there are 3 DFT1 and 3 DFT2 cell lines, and 3 replicates
of each cell line:
