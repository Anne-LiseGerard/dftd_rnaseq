The main goal of our study is to compare the expression of genes and enrichment of pathways related to metabolism of DFT1 to DFT2. To achieve this, two datasets will be analysed: new transcriptomes of DFT1 and DFT2 cell lines, and previously published transcriptomes of DFT1 and DFT2 biopsies. Finally, both datasets will be compared in a multi-contrast enrichment analysis.
